Hello! My name is Jocelyn WangðŸ‘‹ 

Driven by a strong interest in information technology, I would like to change my career from high school Chemistry teaching to web development. I am currently living in Sydney and I have been learning web development online for one year. Here at GitHub, I want to upload some of the work that I have done, for someone with similar experience who wants to learn together with me, for some professionals to help me with improving my skills, even for potential recruiters, to get a preliminary understanding of what skills and experiences I have. I always look forward to gaining new skills, and knowledge and being involved in more projects in the future. Please feel free to connect with me.
